        <h3>Smart Pathway Navigator</h3>
        <span class="date">January 2024 – May 2024</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed an autonomous two-wheeled robotic assistant designed to maneuver, track paths, avoid collisions by detecting obstacles and follow orders according to specific voice commands.</li>
            <li>Implemented in Python for programming and C for instructing the Beaglebone on DebianOS.</li>
            <li>Robot is engineered to intelligently adapt and improve day-to-day activities by enhancing the efficiency and safety of delivery services, contributing to the evolution of self-driving vehicle technologies.</li>
            <li>Implemented threads include obstacle avoidance, real-time audio processing, monitoring, and synchronization.</li>
            <li>For Audio Processing, used a Python Process for voice commands, microphone sensor interface, and audio command processing using naive NLP.</li>
            <li>For obstacle detection, used ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement and obstacle avoidance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chess</h3>
        <span class="date">August 2023 – December 2023</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed an application for a 2-player chess game, focusing on security encryption of player data.</li>
            <li>Implemented the MVC design model to develop the application.</li>
            <li>Used MongoDB to store player stats and account details.</li>
            <li>Designed the application with Express, Node, and React frameworks in JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Integrated OpenSSL certificate for end-to-end encryption of the application.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Crop Yield Prediction -->
    <div class="project">
        <h3>Crop Yield Prediction</h3>
        <span class="date">March 2022 – May 2022</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed a machine learning model using Keras to predict crop yield in Indian agriculture.</li>
            <li>Analyzed historical yield patterns of different crop types in different harvest seasons and the conditions they depend on.</li>
            <li>Performed data preprocessing on a largely noisy dataset using basic data preprocessing techniques.</li>
            <li>Presented the project to a panel of professors for final review.</li>
